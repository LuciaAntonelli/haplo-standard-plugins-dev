# Haplo standard platform plugins development

This repository contains development versions of the standard plugins bundled in the Haplo platform.

When new versions are ready for release, they're copied to the main Haplo repository.

Note that these plugins use private platform APIs, and those APIs may change without notice. Don't use these APIs in your plugins.

### Development

Use `haplo-plugin` to push this to a Haplo server with development enabled. This version will override the built-in plugin.
